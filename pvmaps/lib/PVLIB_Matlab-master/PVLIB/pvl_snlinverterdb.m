%
% Description
%   Retrieve a set of performance parameter coefficients for the 
%   Sandia Performance Model for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Inverters [1]. 
%   The performance parameters are provided as an Excel workbook in the
%   same form as the <Inverters_2012.1.12.xlsx> file included with 
%   the toolbox. A description of each of the inverter parameters associated
%   with the model is given in the Output section of this help document, also,
%   the column numbers of the data within the Excel sheet is listed.
%
% Input
%   uniqueID - Each inverter in the workbook is given a unique
%     identification number. Provide the unique identification number of
%     the desired inverter.
%   DBfile - an optional argument which allows the user to select which
%     "database" file should be read. A full file path may also be necessary
%     if the desired file is not in the MATLAB working path. If the input
%     DBfile is not included, the user will be prompted to select a file
%     using a browsing window. The file should be an Excel workbook with
%     a single worksheet called "Parameters". Row 1 should be text
%     headers. Rows 2-n contain the data specified below in columns 1
%     through 22 (A through V).
%
% Output
%   Inverterparam - A struct of inverter performance parameters with
%     the following components. Note that for more detailed descriptions of
%     each component, please consult reference [1]. Unfilled values in the

%   Inverterparam.MPPTLow = Minimum DC voltage, in volts, at which the
%     maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of the inverter may
%     function. This data is typically found on the specification
%     sheet, but is not required for performance modeling. Given in column
%     17.
%   Inverterparam.MPPTHi = Maximum DC voltage, in volts, at which the
%     maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm of the inverter may
%     function. This data is typically found on the specification
%     sheet, but is not required for performance modeling. Given in column
%     18.
%   Inverterparam.TambLow = Minimum operating temperature of the inverter

%   Inverterparam.Weight = Weight of the inverter in either pounds or
%     kilograms (generally it is unknown due to poor record keeping). 
%     This data is typically found on the specification sheet, but is not 
%     required for performance modeling. Given in column 21.
%   Inverterparam.UniqueID = The unique identification number for each
%     inverter. The manufacturer or model number may change, but the unique
%     ID will remain the same. Given in column 22.
