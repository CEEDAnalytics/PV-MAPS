%% pvl_singlediode 
% Solve the single-diode model to obtain a photovoltaic IV curve
%
%% Syntax
% * |[Result] = pvl_singlediode(IL, I0, Rs, Rsh, nNsVth)|
% * |[Result] = pvl_singlediode(IL, I0, Rs, Rsh, nNsVth, NumPoints)|
%
%% Description
% pvl_singlediode solves the single diode equation [1]:
% |I = IL - I0*[exp((V+I*Rs)/(nNsVth))-1] - (V + I*Rs)/Rsh|
% for I and V when given IL, I0, Rs, Rsh, and nNsVth (nNsVth = n*Ns*Vth) which
% are described later. pvl_singlediode returns a struct which contains
% the 5 points on the I-V curve specified in SAND2004-3535 [3], and can
% optionally provide a full IV curve with a user-defined number of
% points. If all IL, I0, Rs, Rsh, and nNsVth are scalar, a single curve
% will be returned, if any are vectors (of the same length), multiple IV
% curves will be calculated.
%
%% Inputs:
%%
% * *|IL|* - Light-generated current (photocurrent) in amperes under desired IV
%      curve conditions. May be a scalar or vector, but vectors must be of
%      same length as all other input vectors.
% * *|I0|* - Diode saturation current in amperes under desired IV curve
%      conditions. May be a scalar or vector, but vectors must be of same
%      length as all other input vectors.
% * *|Rs|* - Series resistance in ohms under desired IV curve conditions. May
%      be a scalar or vector, but vectors must be of same length as all
%      other input vectors.
% * *|Rsh|* - Shunt resistance in ohms under desired IV curve conditions. May
%      be a scalar or vector, but vectors must be of same length as all
%      other input vectors.
% * *|nNsVth|* - the product of three components. 1) The usual diode ideal 
%      factor (n), 2) the number of cells in series (Ns), and 3) the cell 
%      thermal voltage under the desired IV curve conditions (Vth).
%      The thermal voltage of the cell (in volts) may be calculated as 
%      k*Tcell/q, where k is Boltzmann's constant (J/K), Tcell is the
%      temperature of the p-n junction in Kelvin, and q is the elementary 
%      charge of an electron (coulombs). nNsVth may be a scalar or vector, 
%      but vectors must be of same length as all other input vectors.
% * *|NumPoints|* - Number of points in the desired IV curve. Must be a finite 
%      scalar value. Non-integer values will be rounded to the next highest
%      integer (ceil). If ceil(NumPoints) is < 2, no IV curves will be produced
%      (i.e. Result.V and Result.I will not be generated). The default
%      value is 0, resulting in no calculation of IV points other than
%      those specified in [3].
%
%% Outputs:
%%
% * *|Result|* - A structure with the following fields. All fields have the
%   same number of rows as the largest input vector.
%%
% * *|Result.Isc|* - Column vector of short circuit current in amperes.
% * *|Result.Voc|* - Column vector of open circuit voltage in volts.
% * *|Result.Imp|* - Column vector of current at maximum power point in amperes. 
% * *|Result.Vmp|* - Column vector of voltage at maximum power point in volts.
% * *|Result.Pmp|* - Column vector of power at maximum power point in watts.
% * *|Result.Ix|* - Column vector of current, in amperes, at V = 0.5*Voc.
% * *|Result.Ixx|* - Column vector of current, in amperes, at V = 0.5*(Voc+Vmp).
% * *|Result.V|* - Array of voltages in volts. Row n corresponds to IV 
%        curve n, with V=0 in the leftmost column and V=Voc in the rightmost
%        column. Thus, Result.Voc(n) = Result.V(n,ceil(NumPoints)). 
%        Voltage points are equally spaced (in voltage) between 0 and Voc.
% * *|Result.I|* - Array of currents in amperes. Row n corresponds to IV 
%        curve n, with I=Isc in the leftmost column and I=0 in the 
%        rightmost column. Thus, Result.Isc(n) = Result.I(n,1). 
%
%% Notes:
%%
% # To plot IV curve r, use: plot(Result.V(r,:), Result.I(r,:)) 
% # To plot all IV curves on the same plot: plot(Result.V', Result.I')
% # Generating IV curves using NumPoints will slow down function
%       operation.
% # The solution employed to solve the implicit diode equation utilizes
%       the Lambert W function to obtain an explicit function of V=f(i) and
%       I=f(V) as shown in [2].
