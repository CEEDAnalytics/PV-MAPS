%% pvl_getaoi 
% Determine angle of incidence from surface tilt/azimuth and apparent sun zenith/azimuth 
%
%% Syntax
% |AOI = pvl_getaoi(SurfTilt, SurfAz, SunZen, SunAz)|
%   
%% Description
% Determine the angle of incidence in degrees between a surface and the
% beam of the sun. The surface is defined by its tilt angle from
% horizontal and its azimuth pointing angle. The sun position is defined
% by the apparent (refraction corrected)sun zenith angle and the sun 
% azimuth angle.
%
%% Inputs
%%
% * *|SurfTilt|* - a scalar or vector of surface tilt angles in decimal degrees.
%     If SurfTilt is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SurfTilt must be >=0 and <=180. The tilt angle is defined as
%     degrees from horizontal (e.g. surface facing up = 0, surface facing
%     horizon = 90)
% * *|SurfAz|* - a scalar or vector of surface azimuth angles in decimal degrees.
%     If SurfAz is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SurfAz must be >=0 and <=360. The Azimuth convention is defined
%     as degrees east of north (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, West = 270).
% * *|SunZen|* - a scalar or vector of apparent (refraction-corrected) zenith
%     angles in decimal degrees. If SunZen is a vector it must be of the
%     same size as all other vector inputs. SunZen must be >=0 and <=180.
% * *|SunAz|* - a scalar or vector of sun azimuth angles in decimal degrees.
%     If SunAz is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SunAz must be >=0 and <=360. The Azimuth convention is defined
%     as degrees east of north (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, West = 270).
%
%% Outputs
%%
% * *|AOI|* - A column vector with the same number of elements as any input
%     vectors, which contains the angle, in decimal degrees, between the 
%     surface normal vector and the sun beam vector. 
%
%% Example 1
% Example using sun at top of sky
SurfTilt = 30;
SurfAz = 180;
SunZen = 0;
SunAz = 180;
AOI = pvl_getaoi(SurfTilt, SurfAz, SunZen, SunAz)
%% Example 2
% Example with more representative conditions
SurfTilt = 30;
SurfAz = 180;
SunZen = 35;
SunAz = 220;
AOI = pvl_getaoi(SurfTilt, SurfAz, SunZen, SunAz)
