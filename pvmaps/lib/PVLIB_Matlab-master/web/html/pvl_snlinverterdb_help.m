%% Warning!
% This function will be removed from the PV_LIB Toolbox in future versions.
%  To replace it, we have included a .mat file with inverter parameters
%  from NREL's SAM application, which are updated on a regular basis.
%% Description
% Retrieve a set of performance parameter coefficients for the 
% Sandia Performance Model for Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Inverters [1]. 
% The performance parameters are provided as an Excel workbook in the
% same form as the "Inverters_2012.1.12.xlsx" file included with 
% the toolbox. A description of each of the inverter parameters associated
% with the model is given in the Output section of this help document, also,
% the column numbers of the data within the Excel sheet is listed.
%
%% Inputs
%%
% * *|uniqueID|* - Each inverter in the workbook is given a unique
%     identification number. Provide the unique identification number of
%     the desired inverter.  Unique ID is the unique identifier given to each inverter in the Sandia
% Inverter database. It is *NOT* the row number.
% * *|DBfile|* - an optional argument which allows the user to select which
%     "database" file should be read. A full file path may also be necessary
%     if the desired file is not in the MATLAB working path. If the input
%     DBfile is not included, the user will be prompted to select a file
%     using a browsing window. The file should be an Excel workbook with
%     a single worksheet called "Parameters". Row 1 should be text
%     headers. Rows 2-n contain the data specified below in columns 1
%     through 22 (A through V).
%
%% Outputs
%%
% * *|Inverterparam|* - A struct of inverter performance parameters with
%     the following components. Note that for more detailed descriptions of
%     each component, please consult reference [1]. Unfilled values in the
