% Determine diffuse irradiance from the sky on a tilted surface using Klucher's 1979 model
%
%% Syntax
% |SkyDiffuse =  pvl_klucher1979(SurfTilt, SurfAz, DHI, GHI, SunZen,
% SunAz)|
%
%% Description
% Klucher's 1979 model determines the diffuse irradiance from the sky
% (ground reflected irradiance is not included in this algorithm) on a
% tilted surface using the surface tilt angle, surface azimuth angle,
% diffuse horizontal irradiance, direct normal irradiance, global
% horizontal irradiance, extraterrestrial irradiance, sun zenith angle,
% and sun azimuth angle.
%
%% Inputs
%%
% * *|SurfTilt|* - a scalar or vector of surface tilt angles in decimal degrees. 
%     If SurfTilt is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SurfTilt must be >=0 and <=180. The tilt angle is defined as
%     degrees from horizontal (e.g. surface facing up = 0, surface facing
%     horizon = 90)
% * *|SurfAz|* - a scalar or vector of surface azimuth angles in decimal degrees. 
%     If SurfAz is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SurfAz must be >=0 and <=360. The Azimuth convention is defined
%     as degrees east of north (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, West = 270).
% * *|DHI|* - a scalar or vector of diffuse horizontal irradiance in W/m^2. If DHI
%     is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector inputs. 
%     DHI must be >=0. Values of DHI which are < GHI will be set to GHI.
% * *|GHI|* - a scalar or vector of global horizontal irradiance in W/m^2. If GHI
%     is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector inputs. 
%     GHI must be >=0.
% * *|SunZen|* - a scalar or vector of apparent (refraction-corrected) zenith
%     angles in decimal degrees. If SunZen is a vector it must be of the
%     same size as all other vector inputs. SunZen must be >=0 and <=180.
% * *|SunAz|* - a scalar or vector of sun azimuth angles in decimal degrees. 
%     If SunAz is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SunAz must be >=0 and <=360. The Azimuth convention is defined
%     as degrees east of north (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, West = 270).
%
%% Outputs
%%
% * *|SkyDiffuse|* - the diffuse component of the solar radiation  on an
%     arbitrarily tilted surface defined by the Klucher model as given in
%     Loutzenhiser et. al (2007) equation 4.
%     SkyDiffuse is the diffuse component ONLY and does not include the ground
%     reflected irradiance or the irradiance due to the beam.
%     SkyDiffuse is a column vector vector with a number of elements equal to
%     the input vector(s).
