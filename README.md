### Welcome to PVMAPS Beta 

PVMAPS lets you simulate the energy yield potential of solar farms anywhere in the world. 

Current version supports the following solar farm configurations: (i) systems with fixed-tilted c-Si monofacial and  (ii) systems with vertical bifacial modules with ground-sculpting.

The simulator requires MATLAB (version > 2016a) to be installed on your computer. 

For an example of how to use the simulator, open the 'run_singleLocation.mlx' in this folder  with MATLAB.

If you have any questions, please email to jabir@purdue.edu. If you you would like to report an issue, please also attach a screenshot of the MATLAB's Command Window when the issue occured.
