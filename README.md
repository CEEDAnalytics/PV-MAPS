PVMAPS lets you simulate the energy yield potential of solar farms anywhere in the world. 

Current version supports the following solar farm configurations: (i) systems with fixed-tilted c-Si monofacial and  (ii) systems with vertical bifacial modules with ground-sculpting.

The simulator requires MATLAB (version > 2016a) to be installed on your computer. 

For an example of how to use the simulator, open the 'run_singleLocation.mlx' in this folder  with MATLAB.

For theory underlying the code is discussed in **“Principles of Solar Cells: Connecting Perspectives on Device, System, Reliability, and Data Science” by Professor Alam and Khan  (https://doi.org/10.1142/12139).**
